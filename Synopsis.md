IDEAS:
---------------------------
CITY BLOCK
 a part of city that is inhabited by a members of each demographical group. Each block has 1) a number of citizens (voting), 2) three values of three demographics
Example: A city block A1 has 10 thousand voters of which 20% are ELITE, 60% are MIDDLE and 20% WORKERS
 
NATIONAL STATISTICS
 A set of values that change how different demographic groups are valued and have effect. 
Example: the ELITE's voting probability is 95%, wealth is 1000 and foot work is 10.
Example: the MIDDLE's voting probability is 65%, wealth is 100 and foot work is 100.
Example: the WORKER's voting probability is 25%, wealth is 10 and foot work is 1000.
  
DEMOGRAPHICAL GROUP
 Represented as "elite", "middle" and "workers". Elite are usually the smallest group which controls money and both liberal and conventional viewpoints. Middle have both money and footwork and are more conventional. 
 
 SUPPORT
  Is represented by WEALTH and FOOTWORK. Each block you conquer/affect donates it's SUPPORT to your cause.
 
 THE FINAL SPEECH
  Here your support is important.
 
 VIEWPOINT
  Each group of demographic is transimmitted to fight by randomizing
  Conventional - Liberal
  Right - Left
  
  FIGHT
   fight is presented on a grid with obstacles, adversaries and player. Fight is simple stone-paper-scissors type where each opponent have it's own reaction toward different attack.
Example: Capitalist -> base attack is DEVIOUS/SCAM
          friendly  -> 1 dmg, next attack is SCAM 
          scam      -> 3 dmg, next attack is MOCK
          mock      -> 4 dmg, next attack is SCAM
          Combo: friendly + mock == effect * 4
  
  FINAL SPEECH
   is a specialiced boss fight where player cannot move (or only on podium). Support is counted mostly on this final fight. WEALTH gives bling to the presentation. FOOTWORK gives....
